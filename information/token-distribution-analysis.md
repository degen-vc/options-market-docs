# üìí Token Distribution Analysis

### **What are the distribution differences between this structure and the way Siren is set up.**

**Siren**

* 18% of the supply was sold to VCs at $0.40 per token. They have to wait just a year before being able to dump on retail.
* 10% went to an ‚Äúincubator‚Äù \(another VC\). 
* Only 5% of the supply is being offered to the public via the Balancer LBP. Most tokens sold on the Balancer LBP at the time of writing have sold for over $2 each \(5x what the VCs paid\). 
* Just 6.5% is being offered as liquidity rewards. 
* The ‚Äúinitial team‚Äù \(anons\) is keeping 26.5% of tokens worth $10.6 million at VC prices or $53 million at LBP \($2\) price. 

### **The Degen VC approach is radically different:**

* 18% of the supply will be given at **ZERO COST** to the \#degenhorde \(DGVC LP\) in an \#alphadrop
  * When: March 12th, 2021 around 16.00 UTC. 
* 10% of the supply will go to an accelerator-vault to boost liquidity 
  * When: March 19th, 2021. 
* 32.5% will reward liquidity providers \(5x rewards of Siren with no lockup\) 
  * All locked for in team.finance 30-days prior to launch of pools.
* 4.5% will be allocated to community rewards.
* 35% of the supply will go to Degen VC for project finance and marketing. 
  * 25% of this supply in team.finance lock for 30-days . 

### _**0% will go to VCs**_
