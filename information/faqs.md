# FAQs

## What is Options.Market?

Options Market is a decentralized application that allows anyone to create, trade, and redeem fully-collateralized options contracts for any ERC20 token. 

## What are options?

Options give traders the right \(not obligation\) to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a known time in the future. This allows hedging against price changes, and speculation.

## How does Options.Market work?

Both long and short sides of options contracts are tokenized to create secondary markets. Buyer’s side \(bToken\) gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price. Seller’s/writer’s side \(wToken\) allows the holder to withdraw the collateral \(if the option was not exercised\) or withdraw the exercise payment \(if the option was exercised\) from the contract after expiration.

## What is the value proposition of Options Market?

Options Market fills a unique market niche by catering specifically to sophisticated parties interested in holding and actively trading tokenized options contracts. The nascent cryptocurrency derivatives market has the potential to have trading volume in the trillions, and we are poised to capture a significant share of the market looking for a flexible, fully-decentralized, user-friendly product that allows for self custody and advanced positions. Unlike any other cryptocurrency options platform, Options Market has tokenized both sides of an option contract, allowing for a fully-tradeable options ecosystem that can be traded as easily as a standard ERC20. Options Market allows for both buyers and sellers to mint, buy, and trade in and out of options positions at any time.
